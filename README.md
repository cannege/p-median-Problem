# p-median-Problem
The p-median (facility location) problem is a specific type of a discrete location model, where one wishes to locate p facilities to minimize the demand-weighted total distance between a demand node and the location in which a facility is placed. In this project, p-median problem is solved with Simulated Annealing Algorithm.
